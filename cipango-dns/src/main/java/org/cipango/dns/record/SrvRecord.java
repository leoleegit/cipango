	 * selection to do, to make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of
	 * records containing weights greater than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small
	 * chance of being selected.
	 * 
	 * In the absence of a protocol whose specification calls for the use of other weighting
	 * information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same Priority in the order in which target
	 * hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted. The following algorithm SHOULD be used to
	 * order the SRV RRs of the same priority:
	 * 
	 * To select a target to be contacted next, arrange all SRV RRs (that have not been ordered yet)
	 * in any order, except that all those with weight 0 are placed at the beginning of the list.
	 * 
	 * Compute the sum of the weights of those RRs, and with each RR associate the running sum in
	 * the selected order. Then choose a uniform random number between 0 and the sum computed
	 * (inclusive), and select the RR whose running sum value is the first in the selected order
	 * which is greater than or equal to the random number selected. The target host specified in
	 * the selected SRV RR is the next one to be contacted by the client. Remove this SRV RR from
	 * the set of the unordered SRV RRs and apply the described algorithm to the unordered SRV RRs
	 * to select the next target host. Continue the ordering process until there are no unordered
	 * SRV RRs. This process is repeated for each Priority.
